# Rain_Predictor
It's a Rain Predictor biased on Australian data.
🌧️ Rain Prediction System using Machine Learning & Flask

A full-stack machine learning web application that predicts whether it will rain tomorrow based on today’s weather conditions.
The system is built using Random Forest, trained on real Australian weather data, and deployed using Flask with a modern interactive UI.
